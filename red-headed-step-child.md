## 🚘 **Morning Invocation of the Threshold Guardian**

> *To be spoken at sunrise or first light on the lot, hands open, heart clear.*

**"Today, I rise not just as a seller, but as a steward of roads.**
I stand upon this pavement,
where steel sleeps and dreams await ignition.

Let these cars not be mere machines,
but vessels of freedom, healing, and new beginnings.

May my words be honest,
my eyes discerning,
my handshake clean.

I greet every traveler with respect —
whether they come in wealth, worry, or wonder.

I invoke the spirit of direction:
East for clarity,
South for energy,
West for reflection,
North for discernment.

As engines hum and choices unfold,
may I remember —
the wheel I hand off may carry a soul to destiny.

I do not push. I invite.
I do not convince. I reveal.
I do not close. I open."

> *"Let the gates be open.
> Let the journeys begin.
> And may every road lead them rightly."*
