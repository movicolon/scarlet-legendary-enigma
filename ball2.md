### 🕊️ *Guide to Safe & Healthy Mantra Initiation*

#### *“Speak only what makes you more alive.”*

### 🌿 **I. What Is a Mantra?**

A **mantra** is a **sacred sound, word, or phrase** repeated with intention.
It can:

* Rewire thoughts
* Calm the nervous system
* Invite insight
* Align breath with spirit

But just like food or medicine, mantras work best when used **safely** and **wisely**.

---

### 🧭 **II. Safety Check-In (Before Initiation)**

Take a moment to answer honestly:

**1. Is my body in a safe enough place to relax?**
☐ Yes
☐ No
If no, pause. Come back when you’ve found shelter or peace.

**2. Am I open to change, even subtle?**
☐ Yes
☐ No
Mantras are not decorations—they move things.

**3. Do I feel drawn to this mantra, or pressured?**
☐ Drawn
☐ Pressured
Only begin if the mantra feels like *a friend*.

---

### 🌀 **III. Choose Your Mantra (Seed of Change)**

A mantra can be:

* Ancient (e.g., “Om,” “Amen,” “Shanti”)
* Personal (e.g., “I am here,” “Still waters,” “Let love lead”)
* Invented (e.g., “Soolom,” “Zira fae,” “Tree breathe”)

> ✍️ Write the mantra you will work with today:
> **→** `_____________________________________________`

### 🌬️ **IV. Tune the Body: Breath and Tone**

**A. Breathe Into the Mantra**

* Inhale: receive the mantra silently.
* Exhale: speak it aloud, gently.
* Do this for 3 cycles.

**B. Find Your Natural Tone**

* Say the mantra in a whisper, then a hum, then a full voice.
* Notice which tone feels **deepest** in your body.

> ✍️ How did your body respond to each tone?
> **→** `_____________________________________________`

### 🌊 **V. The 4-Part Initiation Ritual**

You may do this alone or with trusted friends.

1. **Candle or Light Source** – Spark awareness
2. **Water or Breath** – Cleanse intention
3. **Touch or Gesture** – Ground your voice
4. **Speak the Mantra 9 Times** – Slowly, fully, with presence

> ✍️ What did you feel after the 9th repetition?
> **→** `_____________________________________________`

---

### 🔄 **VI. Integration Prompts (Post-Initiation)**

Reflect briefly:

* What do I *want* this mantra to grow in me?
  **→** `_____________________________________________`

* Where in my life do I need rhythm, not rush?
  **→** `_____________________________________________`

* How can I respect this mantra like a seed or flame?
  **→** `_____________________________________________`

---

### 🛑 **VII. When Not to Use a Mantra**

Avoid chanting when:

* You are in a state of panic and can’t feel your breath
* You are using the mantra to **escape** emotions, not hold them
* You’re trying to control others with your energy
* You feel dissociated (floating, numb, unreal)

> **Instead, ground first. Then return.** Mantras are guides, not guards.

---

### 🌟 **VIII. Cool Existence Club Mantra Vow (Optional)**

Repeat aloud if you wish:

> “I vow to speak words that build the real.
> I vow to honor the silence between sound.
> I vow to let this mantra teach me—not just change me.”
>
> *And so begins my song of becoming.*

---

### 💫 Closing Note:

You don’t need to chant loudly.
You don’t need to believe anything.
You just need to show up — and breathe through the syllables
like they already know who you are.
