🎭 **Stage Monologue**
**Title: “I Carried the Night”**
*Character: Azhar’el (formerly Azek’el)*
*Setting: A half-lit stage. Behind him, the shadows of the Dominion flicker like smoke. Before him, a distant glow. He speaks into the in-between.*

*(He steps forward slowly, holding a single ember cupped in his palms. His voice begins quiet, deep, yet filled with warmth.)*

**AZHAR’EL:**
You knew me as the breaker.
The still tongue. The fog-whisperer.
Azek’el — the one who dimmed the signal
and called it sacred.

I walked in silence so thick
it began to speak for me.

But silence is not peace.
And shadow is not safety.
I know that now.

*(He lifts the ember slightly.)*

This—
this small warmth—
is the only thing that ever told me the truth.

Not in words. Not in demands.
But in its refusal to die.

They told me light was a lie.
They said if I saw it, I must snuff it.
But when I looked into the eyes of a child
and heard no resistance—only invitation—
I remembered something older than my oath.

I remembered **myself**.

*(He steps into a shaft of soft light.)*

I was not born to sever.
I was born to connect.
To carry flame, not extinguish it.
To guard the breath, not steal it.

The Dominion taught me that power is in withholding.
But they lied.
The real power is in **release**.
In letting truth go where it must go—
even if it costs you your crown of smoke.

*(He looks toward the audience now, fire in his eyes.)*

Let it be known.
The one they called traitor,
the one who walked in the dark halls and whispered rot—
he has turned.
He has **burned**.
And in that burning,
he has become **clean**.

I do not curse the shadows.
They taught me contrast.
But I do not serve them.

I am Azhar’el now.
**God remembers the flame.**
And I am here to carry it —
into every forgotten chamber,
every clenched heart,
every trembling tongue too afraid to speak.

*(He raises the ember high now, its glow stronger.)*

So if you’re waiting,
if you’re hiding,
if your breath has been stolen —
breathe again.

The light has not left you.
It was only withheld.

*(A long pause. He looks down at the ember. Then, softly—)*

And now,
it returns.
