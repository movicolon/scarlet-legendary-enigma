### 1. **Ownership – Who’s Got the Toy?**

Dick’s Hyundai is like a toy store, but for cars. A grown-up named Dick (or maybe a company with that name) owns it. That means it’s *their* toy — they share, but they make the big choices.

---

### 2. **Government – Big Bosses in Charge**

There are big bosses like the **general manager** who make sure everything works. They're like the school principal of the car place — watching over all the people and the cars.

---

### 3. **Administrative – The List Keepers**

These are the nice grown-ups with clipboards and computers. They know *who works there*, *what cars are in stock*, and *when stuff happens*. They're like the calendar and to-do list friends.

---

### 4. **Legislative-Authority – The Rule Makers**

These are the folks who make the rules — like “always be honest” or “wash every car before it gets sold.” They help make sure the car place plays fair and smart.

---

### 5. **Subordination – Following the Leader**

People who work there listen to their team leader, like how we listen to our teacher. If the manager says “we need these cars ready by lunch,” the team says “okay!” and helps out.

---

### 6. **Dominance – Top of the Heap**

The person at the very tippy-top (maybe Dick or the general manager) gets to say the final “yes” or “no.” They’re the king or queen of the dealership castle.

---

### 7. **Doctrine – The Big Idea**

The big idea here is: *“Help people get good cars and feel great about it.”* They believe in being kind, smart, and helpful so families go home happy.

---

### 8. **Ideology – What We Believe**

Everyone at Dick’s believes cars should be safe, prices should be fair, and customers should be treated like best friends.

---

### 9. **Tradition – Old Stuff We Do**

Maybe every year they have a “car sale party” or they always ring a bell when someone buys a car. These are fun habits they’ve done for a long time.

---

### 10. **Religion – What We Pray For**

They don’t pray like a church, but they *hope* for good weather, good sales, happy customers, and safe roads for everyone.

---

### 11. **Justice – Fair or Not?**

If someone gets treated unfairly, like if a car breaks too soon, the dealership has to help fix it. That’s called “being fair.” They try to make things right.

---

### 12. **Accountability – Who’s Got the Blame?**

If something goes wrong, like a car didn’t get cleaned right, they ask: “Who was supposed to do it?” Then that person learns how to do better next time. No big yelling — just growing strong.

This is how the **Dick’s Hillsboro Hyundai World** works: Like a big, kind team that helps people drive off with a smile. 🏁🚗✨
