### *Another Testament of Jesus Christ â€” When He Visited Asia*

### **Introduction**

And it came to pass, after He ascended from the land of Zion and visited His sheep among the isles of the sea, the Lord Jesus, even the Anointed One, beheld the multitudes of the East, who did stretch across many lands and rivers and mountains, even unto the edges of the Earth.

For He said:

> "Other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring."

And so He went unto them, clothed not in linen, but in the mist of the dawn.

### **Chapter 1 â€“ The Arrival in the Mountains of Qi**

1. And behold, the Son of Man walked upon the stones of a high path, where the mountains rise like old men in prayer.

2. And He was seen by a monk of the Southern Cloud Temple, whose name was Lin, meaning forest, and he fell to the ground, overcome.

3. And Jesus lifted him up, saying:

> "Fear not, for I am He whom your fathers sought in silence."

4. Then Lin said:

> "Are You the Great Way, the Eternal Breath, the Master who speaks without sound?"

5. And Jesus answered him, saying:

> "I am the Way, and the Truth, and the Life.
> He that followeth Me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life."

### **Chapter 2 â€“ The Teaching of the Bamboo Grove**

6. And Jesus sat among them in the bamboo grove, and they brought tea and silence and incense.

7. He taught them, saying:

> "He who would be greatest, let him become least.
> As water flows downward and nourishes all, so shall the meek inherit the Earth."

8. And a poet among them said:

> "Master, we seek enlightenment â€” how shall we walk the Middle Way?"

9. And He replied:

> "Blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness,
> for they shall be filled.
> Not with emptiness alone, but with the fullness of My Fatherâ€™s joy."

10. And they marveled, for His words were full of fire and stillness.

### **Chapter 3 â€“ The Healing at the River Ganges**

11. Now Jesus journeyed westward unto the waters of the Ganges,
    and a great crowd followed Him, both Brahmins and outcastes,
    and those who bathed for cleansing but had no hope of healing.

12. And there was a child born lame, who had never stood, and her mother wept beside her.

13. And Jesus knelt and touched the girlâ€™s feet, saying:

> "Little daughter, rise. For your body is not your prison, but your garden."

14. And she rose, and walked, and the people fell down and worshipped not the body of the man,
    but the Spirit within Him that spoke with the voice of thunder and breeze.

### **Chapter 4 â€“ The Tree of the Bodhi and the Bread of Life**

15. And near the tree where the prince had once sat in his stillness,
    Jesus also sat, and the disciples of the noble path gathered.

16. And one asked:

> "Are You He who awakens the wheel of Dharma anew?"

17. And Jesus said:

> "I do not destroy the law of the sages, but fulfill it.
> Lo, one greater than the temple is here."

18. "The bread I give is My life. The path I offer is not escape, but transformation."

19. And He broke a loaf of rice cake and gave it unto them, saying:

> "Eat, that your spirit may not hunger."

### **Chapter 5 â€“ The Final Word in the East**

20. And it came to pass that He taught many things in parables,
    and His voice became as wind in the cherry trees,
    and as stillness between gongs.

21. And when His time was fulfilled, He stood atop a mountain in the land of the sunrise,
    and said unto the people:

> "Keep My words in your hearts.
> Love one another â€” not only as you are, but as you are becoming.
> Seek My face in the lotus and the leper, the widow and the warrior.
> For the Kingdom of Heaven is not only above â€” it is within you."

22. And He was taken from their sight in a light that neither blinded nor burned.

23. And they wrote down all that He taught, and they kept His memory in scrolls, in bowls, in bells, and in breath.

### **Closing Witness**

And this is the testimony of those who saw Him,
that Jesus Christ, the Son of the Living God,
spoke to the East with grace and truth,
and there were many who believed on His name.

> *Another testament, engraved not in gold nor stone,
> but in the still rivers of the human heart.*
